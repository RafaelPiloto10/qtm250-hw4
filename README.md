# Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API

## Speech-to-Text API Overview:

Google's machine learning Speech-to-Text API accurately converts speech into text using an API powered by Googleâ€™s AI technologies.
It applies Google's most advanced deep learning neural network algorithms for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and enables experimentation,
creation and management of custom resources.

## What We Are Trying to Discover:

We are interested in the correctness of speech-to-text results for people with different backgrounds and accents in English.
We hypothesize that speech-to-text is less efficient for people who have accents.

To keep results consistent, we pulled our lines from the following [Hamlet Script](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/full.html) which was extracted at random with a preference towards it's moderate size:

> Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week; What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Who is't that can inform me?

# Research

Our analysis was conducted on a [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G0NeMCHBcn-Dxu-x2ykpy3ADjupKcC_F?usp=sharing).
Pay close attention to "Action Required" warnings that indicate you may need to change a URI path or provide your authentication keys.

# Results

According to a survey done in 2020 on the accuracy of speech-to-text transcript APIs,
Amazon had an accuracy of 73%, Microsoft had an accuracy of 78% accurate, and Google came in first at 79%.
Using the highly accurate Google speech-to-text transcript API, we are interested in testing its efficiency for
non-native English speakers with different accents. We hypothesize that the speech-to-text accuracy is lower for
non-native English speakers and positively correlated with the number of years spent learning English. The results
show that the errors made by the recruited participants are mostly lower than the literature average of Google API
speech-to-text transcript, at 10.5%, 22,9%,17.4% compared to the reported 21%. These results refute our hypothesis
and shows that Google API speech-to-text transcript service is not less accurate among non-native speakers. Interestingly,
we found no correlation between the number of years spent learning English and the accuracy of the transcript. However, with
the limited number of participants, selection bias of the participants, and potential confounded variables in the reported years
spent learning English, these findings need to be replicated with a larger sample size under a more controlled survey setting for
statistically meaningful interpretation.
